Here's a simple **README** file for your spam detection project:  

---

### **Spam Detection using Logistic Regression**  

This project is a **machine learning-based spam detector** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF Vectorization**.

---

## **Features**  
✅ Converts email text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
✅ Trains a **Logistic Regression model** for classification  
✅ Predicts whether a given email is **Spam (0) or Ham (1)**  

---

## **Installation & Requirements**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```
2. (Optional) Run in **Google Colab** for easy execution.

---

## **Future Improvements**  
🚀 Improve accuracy using **advanced models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Deep Learning)**  
🚀 Deploy as a **web app** using **Flask/Streamlit**  
🚀 Enhance preprocessing (handling emojis, special characters, etc.)
